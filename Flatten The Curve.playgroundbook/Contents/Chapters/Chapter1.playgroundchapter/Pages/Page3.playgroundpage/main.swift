 # ðŸ’€ The Lethality Paradox

 A thing that is quite interesting about viruses is the **lethality paradox**, as some call it.

 Isn't it astonishing that a disease like *Ebola* didn't spread all around the world while *COVID-19* is affecting our entire globe, even when the lethality of *COVID-19* (~ 1 %) **is much lower** than the lethality of *Ebola* (~ 50 %)?

 Well, one of the reasons certainly is that if most infected people die quickly, the chance for them to infect others is much smaller â€“ **which makes diseases with a low (but still significant) lethality paradoxically more dangerous** in a global context.

On this page, you can try out a mutation of *Mock* with a **lethality of 100 %**, an incubation period of 2 seconds and an infectious duration of just half a second.

 - Note:
 As this is just a simulation, results vary more than they do in reality with much more people and a more complex distribution. With this specific configuration, the virus **may be gone immediately** or â€“ if the points have bad luck â€“ spread before. Try out yourself by running the code!
