 # ðŸš· Social Distancing

 During the corona virus pandemic, experts have often been heard calling for us to practise **social distancing** as one of the most effective means to combat a virus. While this surely makes sense, we mostly don't have a real intuition how much of an impact social distancing can have. So let's try out!

 - Note:
 Please remember that each simulation is driven by random initial positions & movement; therefore unique. This is why you may get slightly differing results even with the same configuration.

You surely remember the simulation from the last page and how fast *Mock* could spread. We want to avoid this by **only letting 50 % of our points move**, so please give this setup a try by running the code.
*/

movingPercentage = 50%

/*:
 # ðŸ˜· More Protective Measures

 Well, this is certainly better, but still, **we're not quite there**. So, please set `takeMoreMeasures` to `true`, which will result in a much needed change of behavior:

 * Both 25 % of the moving points and 25 % of the resting points **wear protective gear** and can't be infected by the virus.
 * The points that are infectious are more cautious and **reduce their mobility by 75 %**.

After setting `takeMoreMeasures` to `true`, give it a run and look what happens!

    protectionPercentageAmongMoving = 25%

 Now â€“ **this really makes a difference**!

 There's certainly much more to try out here and you will be able to do it by yourself on the last page. But first, [let's have a look at the lethality paradox](@next)!
