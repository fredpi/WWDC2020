 # ü¶† Introducing Mock

 This playground is all about *Mock*. *Mock* is a virus.

 Within the next 3 minutes, we will simulate its spread, trying to gain insights about how to deal with real viruses by having a look at:

* protective measures
* the lethality paradox
* ... and more

*/

/*:
 ## ‚öôÔ∏è How it works

 To simulate the spread of *Mock*, moving points that may infect each other upon collision are used ‚Äì **simulating real persons**!
 This builds on an idea first suggested by the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/), yet allowing a much more fine-grained configuration. Look forward to the last page where you can **configure the simulation all by yourself** if you want to!

 For you to get to know how the simulation looks and works, just try out a 20 second demo simulation **by running the code**, before we will dive into more details. Try to observe what happens to a **Susceptible** (‚ö™Ô∏è) point when it gets in contact with an **Infectious** (üî¥) point:

* At first, it becomes **Exposed** (light red), which means that is has the virus but isn't **Infectious** (üî¥) yet.
* After 2 seconds (the so called incubation period), it turns **Infectious** (üî¥) itself, threatening other **Susceptible** (‚ö™Ô∏è) points.
* After the next 5 seconds, if it's lucky, it survives and gets **Immune** (üü¢). Yet, at least in this example, there's a 10 % chance of becoming **Dead** (‚ö´Ô∏è).

 When the demo simulation is finished, let's go on and [examine the impact of different protective measures](@next).
