# Flatten The Curve

This playground guides through a series of simulations designed to **enable an intuitive understanding about the spread of viruses and protective measures we can take**. The simulations are based on points within a fixed area that move and may infect each other upon collision. The resulting metrics are then displayed in a diagram that renders live.

## Disclaimer

This playground is my entry to the WWDC 2020 Swift Student Challenge. It had to be created in short time â€“ so I had to make some compromises compared to regular projects.
